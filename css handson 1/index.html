    <h2>What is Css</h2>
    <div>
        <ol class="ord">
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
            <li>CSS descibes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
            <li><span class="ord1">Css is not necessary</span><span class="ord2">CSS saves a layout of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
            <li><span class="ord3">External stylesheets are stored in Css files.</span></li>
        </ol>

    <h2 class="head">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <div>
    <ul class="ul">
        <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside html elements1</li>
        <li>Internal-by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External-by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS,is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However ,<span class="ul1">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demostrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>

    </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="p">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elemens.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you canuse a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by javascript.</p>
    <p class="p">In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on webpage.Once an elment has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p class="p">There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
